# FlashcardsLogin
A flashcard app containing videogame trivia with a user authentication signup &amp; login.

This project creates a user authentication system with Express, MongoDB/Mongoose and Pug. A user can sign up with a username and password, log in, and log out of the app. Once logged in, a flashcard game containing videogame trivia is accessible to the user.

I combined and expanded upon what I learned from two tutorial series on <a href='https://www.teamtreehouse.com'>Team Treehouse</a> (<a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/express-basics-2">Express Basics</a> & <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/user-authentication-with-express-and-mongo">User Authentication with Express and Mongo</a>) to code this. It is heavily commented so that other Treehouse students can easily understand the code and use it along with these tutorials as additional practice. 

If you'd like to join Treehouse for yourself, I'd greatly appreciate it if you could use my referral link below!
